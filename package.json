  "description": "Code Mirror is a VS Code extension that mirrors content from a source file to your target file while you type. It's ideal for creating coding videos and reels where you want to replicate code dynamically.\n\n### Features:\n- **Select Source File**: Choose a file from which content will be mirrored to the active editor.\n- **Start Mirroring**: Begin mirroring content from the selected source file as you type.\n- **Stop Mirroring**: Stop mirroring content and reset the extension's state. The status bar button allows you to quickly restart mirroring if needed.\n- **Status Bar Integration**: Easily start and stop mirroring using a status bar item with clear indicators and tooltips.\n\n### Commands:\n- **Code Mirror: Select Source File**\n  Opens a dialog to select the source file for mirroring. The content of the source file will be loaded and displayed in the status bar to inform you that mirroring has started.\n- **Code Mirror: Stop Mirroring**\n  Stops the mirroring process and updates the status bar to indicate that mirroring has stopped. Click the status bar button to start mirroring again.\n\n### How It Works:\n1. **Select Source File**: Use the command to pick the source file. The content of this file will be loaded and ready to mirror.\n2. **Mirroring Content**: As you type in the target file, the content from the source file will be mirrored in real-time, adjusting the target file's content to match the source.\n3. **Stop Mirroring**: If you want to stop mirroring, use the stop command or click the status bar button. You can restart mirroring at any time by selecting a new source file.\n\n### Usage:\n- Click on the status bar item to select the source file and start mirroring.\n- Use the command palette (Ctrl+Shift+P) to access the commands for selecting the source file or stopping mirroring.",
